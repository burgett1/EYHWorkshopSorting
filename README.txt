Here is the Python code to sort Cornell's yearly EYH participants into workshops based on partner assignemnts/preferences/workshop capacities, etc.

The files included in this repository are very limited at the moment, but I will update to include more pertinant information when time permits.

About the code: This code is very "kludgey", but works. The code is certainly not optimal and the sorting algorithm(s) will be revised at a later time (likely will create a new branch and then merge to Master). There may be some small bugs in the code that prevent it from running completely on the first attempt, if that is found to be the case, keep trying to run the code a few times before giving up.

More details to come later.
